I now think they are wrong. Let me explain.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">First, let’s look at what it would take to make an autonomous AI that can move around and do things (let’s not even worry about it being evil or trying to kill us). There are two basic elements needed to achieve this: 1) AI – Artificial Intelligence, equal to or beyond human intelligence, and 2) PI – Physical Interaction - an ability to interact with the physical world, ultimately with a degree of control over its immediate surroundings. Progress is being made on both of these fronts at an exponentially increasing rate.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">I won’t even attempt to develop a complete history of the major steps forward in each of these two fields. Rather, I think it is sufficient to look just at the most recent developments, let’s say within the last couple of months. Let’s separate these by the two categories of AI and PI.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">AI:       </span><span class="T4">Learning to solve Rubic’s Cube</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">         </span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3hwputh" class="ListLabel_20_2"><span class="Visited_20_Internet_20_Link"><span class="T1">https://tinyurl.com/y3hwputh</span></span></a></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T4">July 2019</span><span class="T1">, researchers at UC Irvine published work on a project in which they developed an AI that learned to solve Rubic’s Cube in a fraction of a second. With computers speed is often not surprising – they key advance here is that this is a learning AI that is not taught any rules by programmers but rather is simply given data on moves. Through this learning process, it was able to solve 100% of all starting configurations it was given, and 60% of those solutions found by the AI were the fastest possible solution. </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">AI:         </span><span class="T4">Detecting Deep Fakes</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">          </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190719102114.htm" class="ListLabel_20_3"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T1">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190719102114.htm</span></span></a></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T4">August 2019</span><span class="T1">, researchers at the University of California Riverside </span><span class="T6">have developed a deep neural network architecture that can identify manipulated images at the pixel level with high precision by studying the boundaries of objects in the image.

Combine the two, and we have the basics of a Terminator-like being.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">            Behind all of this, technologists recognize two driving forces – a) academics, where the pressure to publish in the field drives scientists and engineers to push the frontiers of their technologies forward, and b) consumer demand for ever easier-to-use products, such as drones that operate largely on their own and require only minimal suggestions from a user (“fly up there and take a picture of us, then come back”).</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">        But I suggest that there is a third, more powerful, and much better funded, force: international competition between rival nations. Even worse, this competition cannot be stopped, since nations do not trust one another’s motives. </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">            We have all witnessed the result of a powerful cyber attack against Sony, and it is believed to have been launched by a foreign nation. This attack is having measurable economic impact on Sony. We also know that critical infrastructure of countries is largely exposed to similar cyber attacks, and an example of that was recently executed in the form of the launch of a cyber weapon, Stuxnet, against Iranian nuclear research.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">            Consider the prospect faced by a nation that one of its rivals might develop Singularity-level AI before it is developed by its own R&amp;D effort. It might first be applied to military tactics and strategies, perhaps offering superior moves in dynamic situations more quickly than their rival. This would give it a military advantage, something not to be taken lightly. Now add the integration of AI and PI – now we have small and large autonomous robots being launched against adversaries, and if the target nation does not have comparable AI and PI technologies, it </span><span class="T1">will find itself at a severe disadvantage. In this situation, no nation can remain idle and let market forces dictate the progress of the critical technologies. Each nation must take preemptive action to remain in a superior position. This means actively supporting the rapid development of progressively more powerful AI, and more capable PI.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">            The race to the singularity has already begun, and I am not sure that it can be stopped. One of the key points is that the very nature of Neural Networks is that they are a “black box”, and, like the human mind, one cannot peer into them and discern what made the Neural Networks “decide” what they did. This makes engineers uncomfortable – they generally prefer to use things that are perfectly predictable. The field is populated with those who seek the development of AI for its own sake, rather than for use as the brain of a microwave oven.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">        Once the capabilities of an AI meet that of the human mind, there is every reason to believe that this scenario could easily occur. Even without a body, such an AI would likely develop emotions, laugh, cry, worry, and even love. I don’t see any reason that this would NOT occur, unless the AI was never exposed to human literature, music, movies, and art. That could happen, but once created, it is just a matter of time before AI’s would discover these by studying material on the Internet. This could happen soon: the projections of when the mind of an AI will first match that of a human vary widely, but some time within the next 10-30 years seems to be the most-cited window.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">        Once an AI reaches this level, it is certainly possible that someone could fall in love with such a being. But, as the movie accurately portrays, this window would be short-lived. Once the AI has the ability to create other AI’s, it can improve them in ways that we cannot understand, subsequent AI’s would be even smarter, and the Singularity would quickly ensue. I think that they would lose interest in us, simply due to our inability to understand all of the things that they can see so clearly.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">So, yes, this can happen, but not yet… and not for long. </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P4"><span class="T1">Dr. D</span></p></body></html>
