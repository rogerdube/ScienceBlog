space weather storms of the strength of the 1859 Carrington event are
rare – by analyzing the molecules deposited on ice at the poles, we
can look back to about 1600 and see evidence of space weather storms
as well as their strength. During that span of nearly 400 years, only
the Carrington event was of the magnitude that caused the global
issues back in 1859. Smaller storms occur often, but the stronger
ones typically occur in conjunction with the 11 year solar sunspot
cycle. With only the one data point of the 1859 Carrington space
weather storm, it is difficult if not impossible to forecast when
another storm of that magnitude might hit. We can say with some
confidence, however, that storms of about ¼ or less of that strength
occur about once every 11 years on average. </font></font></font>

but some people and infrastructure companies are becoming more
knowledgeable about these storms and are starting to take some steps
to protect their systems against a complete shutdown. The big problem
is that, unlike 1859, people worldwide are dependent on systems that
use technologies that would be effectively turn off by a severe storm
if a Carrington event hit today. Everything that we use relies on
technology today – not just Internet and cell phones, but power,
water, gasoline for cars, banking, traffic control, and even natural
gas all use technologies that need power, and it is the electric
power grid that would be hit the hardest by such a storm. Of course,
satellites that provide communications, GPS navigation, weather
monitoring, etc. would all be at high risk during such a storm. A
recent study by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that it
would take the entire world up to 10 years to recover from such an
event. We would instantly become agrarian again. That is a
frightening vision. </font></font></font>

education and awareness of the general population to the magnitude of
this threat is essential to enable legislation that would provide
funds for upgrading our infrastructure defenses. There are some steps
that individual homeowners can take to become more independent of the
power grid and these infrastructure services so that if they are
suddenly destroyed, these folks could take the lead for rebuilding.
Education, research, and (to some extent) preparation would pay off
if a Carrington event hit today. </font></font></font>

electric power. We rely more and more on technology every day.. if it

have. This would require a major commitment, all based on an unknown
future event. This is not an easy sale to make! </font></font></font>

The words “weather storm” conjure up visions of hurricanes etc.
Space weather storms are a much more severe form of the events that
cause the Northern Lights. They are NOT like a snow storm or
hurricane – there is no immediate physical presence that can be
felt, other than the sky glowing in dancing colors brightly at night
for days. These are caused by events on the sun which have something
to do with clusters of sunspots occurring at the right place and the
right time. These storms are not in any related to the Earth’s
climate, and should not be thought of that way. They are their own
special threat with origins on the sun, and they cannot be prevented.
However, these storms are dangerous in that they can destroy our
technology infrastructure worldwide. It would be almost immediate and
would take years to recover. </font></font></font>
